        <p>
            I'm a Python Developer with a knack for building clean, efficient solutions
            and a drive to explore the “why” behind every line of code.
            Development isn't just syntax — it's engineering experiences that solve
            real problems and unlock opportunity.
        </p>

        <p>
            When I’m not behind the IDE, I operate at the intersection of creativity
            and technology. From music to gaming to content creation,
            I’m constantly inspired by how digital systems bring people together.

        <blockquote>
            “Every great developer was once a beginner who refused to quit.
            With enough focus, you can bridge the gap between who you are
            and who you want to become.”
